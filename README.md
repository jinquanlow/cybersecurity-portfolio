**A Short Intro About Me (How I Became Interested in Cybersecurity)**

I did not begin my professional journey in cybersecurity. My academic background is in mechanical engineering, and at that time, computer networks were far from anything I expected to work with. However, my current role required me to develop a deeper understanding of networked systems, and that exposure led me to cybersecurity. I became increasingly interested in how systems fail, how adversaries operate, and how defenders identify and respond to abuse.

Recognizing that theoretical knowledge alone was insufficient, I sought opportunities to apply what I was learning beyond textbooks and certification courses. This motivated me to participate in Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions, which have since become an essential part of my ongoing development as a cybersecurity professional. Through CTFs, I continue to refine my technical skills, strengthen my analytical thinking, and challenge myself to improve every day.

**Reflection on My Recent CTF Experience**

Over the month of November 2025, I dedicated significant time to preparing for the National Cyber League (NCL) Fall Season. My preparation included working through the Gymnasiums, studying structured practice labs, and learning from experienced CTF players. These efforts helped me build a stronger foundation and approach the competition with greater strategy and confidence.

The Individual Game has always been enjoyable for me because it offers a direct way to measure my growth in areas such as enumeration, analysis, and reasoning. It also helps me identify knowledge gaps, revisit challenging concepts, and improve through repetition — all of which have become essential parts of my self-development.

I also look forward to competing as part of a team. It allows me to meet new peers, collaborate on complex problems, and combine our strengths to tackle diverse challenges. Team-based CTFs introduce another dimension to the learning experience: communication, strategic coordination, and the value of learning from others’ perspectives.

Together, these experiences have shaped how I approach cybersecurity — not just as a collection of technical skills, but as a continuous process of improvement, reflection, and growth.

**Highlights From My Recent CTF Participation**

One of the most meaningful milestones in my CTF journey was participating in the National Cyber League (NCL) Fall Season, where I ranked in the 92nd percentile for the Individual Game and the 97th percentile for the Team Game. These results were a clear reflection of the hard work I put into preparing for the competition and demonstrated my ability to apply cybersecurity skills across a wide range of domains.

Beyond the NCL season, my involvement in other CTF environments — including SANS NetWars and various community competitions — has broadened my technical exposure and reinforced my ability to analyze, adapt, and collaborate under pressure. These experiences have played an important role in shaping my growth as a cybersecurity professional and deepening my commitment to continuous improvement.

Learning never stops, and I will continue refining my skills, taking on new challenges, and sharing my experiences with others who are interested in the cybersecurity field.
